Blue-Green CI/CD Deployment with Infrastructure Automation and Kubernetes Management

Project Description: A Blue-Green CI/CD Deployment Pipeline integrated with Infrastructure Automation and Kubernetes Management on Amazon EKS!

This project combines Terraform, Kubernetes, and modern CI/CD practices to streamline deployments, ensure seamless environment switching, and enhance security.

Infrastructure Deployment

Using Terraform, I automated:

Creating a VPC with subnets, internet gateways, and route tables.

* Designing security groups for EKS clusters and worker nodes with IAM roles for permissions

â€¢Deploying an Amazon EKS cluste with worker nodes to manage Kubernetes

workloads.

This setup ensures fast, repeatable, and reliable infrastructure provisioning.

Pipeline Configuration

Built a robust CI/CD pipeline with:

* Maven3, Docker, Trivy and SonarQube for complete lifecycle automation.

* Environment variables like DEPLOY ENV DOCKER TAG. and WITCH TRAFFIC for flexible deployments.

Pipeline Stages

The pipeline automates key steps:

1. Git Checkout: Clones the GitHub repository.

2. Compile: Builds the project using Maven.

3. Tests: Executes unit tests.

4. Trivy FS Scan: Detects vulnerabilities in the filesystem.

5. SonarQube Analysis: Ensures code quality through quality gates.

6. Build: Packages the application into a deployable artifact.

7. Publish Artifacts to Nexus: Manages artifact versions in Nexus.

8. Docker Build & Push: Builds and pushes images to Docker Hub.

9. Trivy Image Scan: Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities.

Deployment Stages

MySQL Deployment. Configures and deploys MySQL on Kubernetes. Application Deployment: Deploys backend and frontend services.

Blue-Green Deployment: Dynamically switches between blue and green environments for zero-downtime rollouts.

Traffic Switching: Redirects traffic seamlessly using Kubernetes service patches.

* Verification: Validates health and stability post-deployment.
